My name is Mbaye Toure ,and I am going to be a sophmore next year at wisdom Highschool in HTX . This summer I made a ultrasonic security system. My ultasonic security system how does it work and what does it do ? well let me tell you. My ultrasonic system it detects how close someone is to my sensor when that hapen my light will turn off showing that it is detecting something, and if you are trying to access it you will have to put in the pasword and scan my rfid card.
I am going to Show you a picture of my system then I will tell how evrything works, and how I did it .

In this project I first conected my ultrasonic sensor to my elego mega 2560 R3wich is basicly the brain of the whole project I had to conect my vcc wich is the 5 volt I also conected the trig pin the echo,and my ground . The echo pin and the trig pin are digital pins ,but what I did is that I decided to conect my digtal pins through my breadboard using long male to male wires  so I can have more space and would not have trouble,and to make my life easier the breadboard is where you develope an electronic circuit and wiring .
