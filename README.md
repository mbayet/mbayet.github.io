# Introduction

My name is Mbaye Toure ,and I am going to be a sophmore next year at wisdom Highschool in HTX . This summer I made a ultrasonic security system. My ultasonic security system how does it work and what does it do ? well let me tell you. 
 
# ultrasonic security system 
My ultrasonic system it detects how close someone is to my sensor when that hapens my light will turn off showing that it is detecting something, and if you are trying to access it you will have to put in the pasword and scan my rfid card.


# Arduino Mega 2560 R3
In this project I started by having my Arduino Mega 2560 R3 you guys are wondering how does it work well let me explain.The Arduino Mega 2560  R3 is what I like to call the brain,because it is basicly like a motherboard where everything is controlled,and where you connect your power .

# Breadboard
After already having your arduino mega you will need a breadboard.A breadboard is where you can allow allow easy and quick creation of temporary electronic circuits or to carry out experiments with circuit.
